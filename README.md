## RSSI Data Aggregator

Backend Aggregation and Calculation code, along with the accompanying Arduino Harware code, for the [Otago Polytechnic](http://www.op.ac.nz/) Bachelor of Information Technolgy Final Project: [Autonomous Movement](http://wiki.ict.op.ac.nz/Autonomous-Movement.MainPage.ashx).

This code is designed to allow tracking of the movements of players on a sports field, by means of a tag attached to each player sending signals to base stations arrayed around the field. The base stations then send that data to the aggregator running on a computer, where it is smoothed and calculated to output the location of each player.

Our full Technical Report on the project, containing design details and justifications, can be found [here](https://github.com/DBeath/rssi-aggregator/blob/master/Autonomous%20Movement%20Technical%20Report.pdf). Any additional information can be found at the project page above, while it still exists.
